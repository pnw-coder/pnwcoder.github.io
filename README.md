Question 1:
    For me the most challenging thing was trying to get the navbar background to not cover up any space on the header and then once a user scrolls off the header to have the background become visible. While you are able to do a lot with only html and css I did read that you can incorporate a lot more using javascript in web page design. This assignment toook me about five days to complete. I struggled with getting my links working and making sure the folder paths were correctly setup. 

Question 2:
    I tried to be mindful of screen size when making my site mobile friendly. Thinking about the orientation of the navbar and any media on the screen. Having taken note of different mobile screen sizes I was able to write some media queries that would alter my website to be more mobile friendly when a user accessed it via their phone. 

Question 3: 
    I tried to take into acccount how I could capture user's attention to the content of my website. By keeping the background minimal and having an inviting header my website aims to attract users to read about my education, experience, projects and hobbies. I am proud of the fact that I got all of my webpages running and set up the links between them correctly so that a user can seemlessly explore my website.

Question 4: 
    Given more time I would have tried to solve the issue of my navbar background covering up a portion of my header. I struggled with trying to find the balance between colors so that my navbar was easy to find but not too distracting. In the end I settled to have the text in my navbar match my other headers which meant i need to leave the background on so the text would be readable. If I had more resources I would have looked into how I could have had the background of my navbar start off as transulcent and then transition into a solid color once a user started scrolling. 

Question 5: 
    I would say that I spent about 15 hours on this assignment. Most of the process was straightforward but I did struggle with setting up my links correctly and I played around with trying to get my navbar background color just right. Both of these things took some time to figure out however, once I created the base skeeleton of my four webpages adding the content to each did not take too much time.
